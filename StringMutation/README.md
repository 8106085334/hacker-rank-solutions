# Replace Character in a String by Index

This script modifies a string by replacing the character at a specific index with a new character.

## Features
- Takes a string as input.
- Takes an index and a replacement character as input.
- Replaces the character at the specified index with the provided character.
- Outputs the modified string.

## How It Works
1. The script reads a string from the user using `input()`.
2. It then takes a second input where the index (integer) and the new character (string) are provided, separated by a space.
3. The string is converted to a list to allow mutation.
4. The character at the specified index is replaced.
5. The modified list is converted back to a string and printed.

## Example Usage
```plaintext
Input:
hello
1 e

Output:
hallo
